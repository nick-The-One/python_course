# Ideas for future

* Make them write project draw script:
  * You can't draw your own project
  * You can't plan your own project
  * Fair projects distribution by authors
* Use these as git submodule for website?
* [Standart library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypApmOoCRSc)
* Engineering culture:
  * Interview with engineer from another company
    * Don't use dependency managers
    * Don't use proper distribution for in-house modules
    * Ran test «at least once a year»
    * No linting
* Code is executed left to right top to bottom — like I told you on intro meeting
* Optimization: precompile, JIT, profilers
