# Ideas for future

* Make them write project draw script:
  * You can't draw your own project
  * You can't plan your own project
  * Fair projects distribution by authors
* Use these as git submodule for website?
* go over walrus and case match
* https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python
* [Standart library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypApmOoCRSc)
* Engineering culture:
  * Interview with engineer from another company
    * Don't use dependency managers
    * Don't use proper distribution for in-house modules
    * Ran test «at least once a year»
    * No linting
  * Documenting things
    * comments
    * docstrings
      * google
      * that other one format
    * sphinx
    * doctest
    * give everyone a piece of code (func/class) and make them document it
* Code is executed left to right top to bottom — like I told you on intro meeting
* Optimization: precompile, JIT, profilers
* Dev env: look into bandit 
* list comprehension https://betterprogramming.pub/python-list-comprehensions-are-more-powerful-than-you-might-think-3363a90e5bb0
* dict methods etc https://medium.com/@dreamferus/python-dictionary-operations-you-should-know-bb91a77bd97a
